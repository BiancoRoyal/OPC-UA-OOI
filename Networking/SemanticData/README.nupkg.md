# `RxNetworking` of Semantic-Data

The `UAOOI.Networking.SemanticData` library is designed to be a foundation of developing application programs that are taking part of message-centric communication pattern and interconnected using the reactive networking concept described in the [Semantic-Data Processing Architecture](https://commsvr.gitbook.io/ooi/semantic-data-processing/semanticdata).

For more in-depth information about creating `OOI Reactive Application` exchanging data over the network using the reactive networking pattern, see [Getting Started Tutorial](https://commsvr.gitbook.io/ooi/reactive-communication/readmegettingstartedtutorial).

To promote interoperability this library is a collection of types aimed at implementation of the [Part 14 PubSub](https://commsvr.gitbook.io/ooi/reactive-communication/readme.pubsubmtf) standard.

The code is tested using the Unit Tests located in the project: [Networking.SemanticData.UnitTest](https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI/tree/master/Networking/Tests/SemanticDatalUnitTest)
