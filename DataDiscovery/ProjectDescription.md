# DataDiscovery Project Description

Description is covered by the section of the ebook:

* [Global Data Discovery](https://commsvr.gitbook.io/ooi/global-data-discovery/datadiscovery)

The **Data Discovery** procedure may be applied to the following scenarios:

* **Design time data discovery** - all about using data definition \(OPC UA Information Model - semantics\) to configure data bindings and data distribution over the wire.
* **Startup process** - all about bootstrapping process of the `OOI Reactive Application`.
* **Operational time** - all about dynamic data definitions and security stuff management \(certificates, keys\)

## Goal

All tasks required to release the `DataDiscovery` package meeting above described requirements.

## Work-space

The `DataDiscovery` branch contains all related modifications, i.e. different features or ideas in progress at any given time â€“ some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. It is an environment where new ideas are tried out. The branch won't be merged with `master` until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're collaborating with. To merge the following conditions must be met:

* the code is error-free
* all unit tests have to pass
* the documentation is ready to be exposed in the ebook
* all integration tests have to pass

If harmonization with other branches is required PR modification to the  `DataDiscovery` branch.
