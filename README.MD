## CHARTER

### What is Object Oriented Internet

In this project, C\# deliverables supporting a new Machine To Machine \(M2M\) communication approach based on the **Data-Oriented Architecture** paradigm is to be researched. The goal is to provide a generic solution for publishing and updating information in a context that can be used to describe and discover it by software applications. It is implemented based on the [OPC Unified Architecture](http://goo.gl/y4EHUn) - a newly emerging industrial integration standard that fulfills the proposed architecture requirements.

The [Object Oriented Internet](https://fedcsis.org/proceedings/2015/pliks/160.pdf) article published in **Proceedings of the Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems** captures description of this idea.

## Content

The `SemanticData` folder contains projects related to support the [OOI Semantic Data Processing Architecture](./SemanticData/README.MD). Processing of the OPC UA Data Outside of the Server context is based on the OPC **UA Semantic Data** concept.

This project is aimed to workout deliverables supporting Process Data handling over Internet including but not limiting to:

• Data Edition – UI allowing display and edition of any custom data

• Data serialization and deserialization - see white-paper: [Address Space Interchange XML](http://www.commsvr.com/InternetDSL/commserver/P_DowloadCenter/P_Publications/P-150101E-AddressSpaceInterchangeXML.pdf)

• Data binding – to define how the process data relate to the real world

• Data Validation - see project description [OPC UA NodeSet Validation](./SemanticData/UANodeSetValidation/README.MD)

• Data Prototyping - methods and tools to design custom data types

• [Data Discovery – methods and tools to find the data over the network](./DataDiscovery/README.MD)

In scope there are also deliverables supporting:

• Exposition of the Process Data in the context of Metadata [OPC UA Address Space Model Designer](http://www.commsvr.com/Products/OPCUA/UAModelDesigner.aspx)

• Browsing \(using the schematics\) of the Metadata to selectively access requested Process Data

• Modeling and representation of the Metadata - see white-paper: [OPC UA Information Model Deployment](http://www.commsvr.com/InternetDSL/commserver/P_DowloadCenter/P_Publications/20140301E_DeploymentInformationModel.pdf)

• Validation of the semantics and consistency of the Metadata - see project [USNodeSetValidationUnitTestProject](./SemanticData/UANodeSetValidation/README.MD)

The presented approach is a real proposal for new technology wave based on the existing Internet infrastructure because it allows vendors to provide generic off-the-shelf products tested independently for interoperability.

### Out of scope

Out of scope is any work on exchanging the Process Data and Metadata over the network. The hope is that the interoperability can be gained as the result of usage of the OPC Unified Architecture international standard.

### Conclusion

I hope it is a good place to prototype and converge the OPC UA communication technology with Semantic Data, Semantc Web, Internet Of Things, Plug and Play, Global Data Discovery, Selective Availability, etc. concepts. My goal is to bridge a gap between OPC UA technology and Industrial IT Application Domains.

In this section, you will learn how to cite the "Software" using the DOI number. A DOI number is a unique identifying number for the Software version. Because this repository has a DOI, use the DOI in your citation for the article or any derived work, like this:

Postol, M., Object Oriented Internet: [Target Part Name], https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI, [year]
http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1198852. 

Replace [year] with the current year and [Target Part Name] with the name (or names) of the files you are referring to.
