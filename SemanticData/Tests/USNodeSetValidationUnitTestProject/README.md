# UANodeSet Validation Unit Test

To validate a new model add the code to the project and XML file to the XMLModels in this project. If the validation test does not recognize an error the code in the UANodeSetValidation must be improved. In this case add issue or modify the code on your fork and add purge request after finishing.
